    "### Things to do:\n",
    "(a): Update ant_colony_modified.py to output node names in the paths instead of coordinates and other modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b): Calculate all \"reasonable\" (may be all) paths to subnodes and compare CP costs. Reason being that this is not exactly a mTSP (multiple travelling salesmen problem) because there are limited connections between nodes (which leads to a sparse connection matrix) and I do not need a cycle containing all nodes. Also, this is an asymmetrical problem (going into the subnodes is where the profits are, not going from subnodes to main nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c): Modify algorithm to take CP costs into account so there are constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d): Worker constraints (stamina, work speed, skills, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(e): Once I get the algorithm working then I can expand the project past its limitations by web-scraping one of the online BDO databases (bdodae)."
