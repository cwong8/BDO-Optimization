# BDO-Optimization

This is a personal project of mine where I attempt to optimize the worker system in the online MMORPG Black Desert Online. The worker system consists of a map of main nodes and their subnodes that can be reached by connecting together nodes starting from a city. For a detailed map see: http://www.somethinglovely.net/bdo/.

Each node in the game has a corresponding contribution point (CP) cost. Main nodes serve the purpose of connecting a player's network of nodes in-game. For example, players can connect a path between two cities to reduce the transportation cost of items between those two cities or giving themselves a route from one main node's trade material to the city. Within many main nodes are subnodes which contain resources that players can harvest using their worker empire. These subnodes serve as a way to passively gather materials while they "play" the game. I use the word play loosely because to progress at any decent rate within the game requires the players to leave their computers on for absurd amounts of time (i.e. overnight, while they go to work) so their in-game workers continue to gather materials. Basically, this means that the game becomes a second "job" for most of its serious players. These are the players that you will see in the towns processing raw materials for hours everyday while they are away from their computers (AFK).
